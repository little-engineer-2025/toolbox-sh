# Documentation

To generate the documentation from the script source code it is used the
[shdoc](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc) tool.

You can re-generate the documentation by: `make doc`

## Adding a new file

- You need to edit the `Makefile` file and add a new line to the target `doc`
  to generate for your new file.
